// Checklist:
// When started, it will ask you if you want to do a calculation. If you answer “Y” it will ask three questions:

// What is the first number?

// Which operation do you want to do?

// What is the second number?

// The calculator will then respond in this way: “5 + 7 = 12”.

// It will then loop back to ask you if you want to do a calculation.

// Remember that when the user types in, the operation it’s a string. You can compare that string to other strings like “+” or “-” to see what operation needs to be done. Don’t forget to cast numerical input to actual numbers!

// You can assume the user types in the correct character for the operation. If you want to, you can check this but you don’t need to.
